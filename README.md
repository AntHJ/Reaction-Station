# Create your own or remake classics
Have you ever seen or played games such as Dragons lair, Space Ace, Cobra Command?
The gameplay fully relies on quick time responses like an interactive video..

- Make a folder in ux0:video/
- add a compatible mp4
- (optional) add a cover image
- launch the app and select the video with Triangle to edit

# The timeline

![](https://github.com/AntHJ/Reaction-Station/blob/main/Reaction%20Station%20timeline.png)

if your familiar with video editors then this may look kind of familiar, if not then it may look confusing..
the bar represents the timeline of your video, with various markers.

- Yellow bar is the entire video
- Orange bar is the section selected for the Attract/Intro video
- White  [1 1]    [2    2]   are Stages/Levels
- Blue is end credits
- each green line is a saved quick time event
- the white circle is your current timeline position

Yes i know its confusing, Yes i know its time consuming but for your own random creations it could also be fun..
I will say that it has take me MANY.!! hours to recreate the full Cobra Command and Mad Dog 2
